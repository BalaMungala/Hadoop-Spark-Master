Shared storage:-

The standby Node and the active namnode keep in sync of  each other by using the shared storage device.
the active name node logs the record of any modification done in its name space to edit logs presents in this shared storage.
the standby nodes reades the changes made in the edit logs in this shared storage and applies it to its own namespace.
now, in case failover, the standby updates its metadata info using the edit logs in the shared storage first then it takes responsibity of the active namenode.
as a administrator , you must need to configure at least one fencing method to avoid the split-brain scenario.



Gracefull failover :- we manually initiate the failover for routine maintainance
Automatic failover :- 

In this case , failover is initiated automatically in case of Namenode failure (unplanned event)
Apache Zookper is taking care of HA in the cluster
ZKFC is a client that also monitors and manages the namenode status.
it is also responsible for monitoring the health of the name nodes
