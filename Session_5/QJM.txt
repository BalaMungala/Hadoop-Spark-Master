HDFS HA Architecture:-

Active Name node
Stand by name node


Two HA techiques:-
Quorum journal node
Shared storage

Quorum journal method:-

1:-The standby Namenode and active name node keep in sync with each other through a separate group of nodes or daemons called journal nodes.
2:-journal nodes follows a ring topology
3:- active name node is responsible for updating the edit logs(meta data info.) present in the journal nodes.
4:-standby node reads the changes made to edits logs in the journal node and applies it to ites own namespace in a constant manner.
5:-During the failover, the standby makes sure that it has updated its meta data information from journal nodes before coming the new active namenode. this makes a current namespace state synchronized with the stat before failover.
6:- Ip address of both the NAme node are availble to all the datanodes and they send the heart beats and block location information to both the namenode., this provies a fast failover as the Standby name node has an updated information about the block location in the cluster

Fencing method:-
only one Namenode write at time.
the journal nodes performans this fencing methos by allowing only one namenode to be write at a time
the standby namenode takes the responsiblity to read from the journal nodes
