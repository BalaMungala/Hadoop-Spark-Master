General formula to estimate Hadoop storage (H):

Note:- Not applicable for all the situation :-

H=c*r*S/(1-i) 

where: 
c = average compression ratio.
r = replication factor. 
S = size of data to be moved to Hadoop. This could be a combination of historical data and incrementa data. 
i = intermediate factor. It is usually 1/3 or 1/4. 

Example: With no compression i.e. c=1, a replication factor of 3, an intermediate factor of .25=1/4 

H= 1*3*S/(1-1/4)=3*S/(3/4)=4*S 
With the assumptions above, the Hadoop storage is estimated to be 4 times the size of the initial data size. 

2. This is the formula to estimate the number of data nodes (n): 

n= H/d = c*r*S/(1-i)*d 

where d= disk space available per node.
