What are the key components of YARN?

The basic idea of YARN is to split the functionality of resource management and job scheduling/monitoring into separate daemons. YARN consists of the following different components

ResourceManager - The ResourceManager is a global component or daemon, one per cluster, which manages the requests to and resources across the nodes of the cluster.

NodeManager - NodeManger runs on each node of the cluster and is responsible for launching and monitoring containers and reporting the status back to the ResourceManager

ApplicationMaster is a per-application component that is responsible for negotiating resource requirements for the resource manager and working with NodeManagers to execute and monitor the tasks.

Container Container is YARN framework is a unix process running on the node that executes an application-specific process with a constrained set of resources (Memory, CPU, etc.)

What is ResourceManager in YARN?
 
The YARN ResourceManager is a global component or daemon, one per cluster, which manages the requests to and resources across the nodes of the cluster.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ResourceManager has two main components - Scheduler and ApplicationsManager

Scheduler - The scheduler is responsible for allocating resources to and starting applications based on the abstract notion of resource containers having a constrained set of resources.

ApplicationManager - The ApplicationsManager is responsible for accepting job-submissions, negotiating the first container for executing the application specific ApplicationMaster and provides the service for restarting the ApplicationMaster container on failure.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the scheduling policies available in YARN?

YARN scheduler is responsible for scheduling resources to user applications based on a defined scheduling policy. YARN provides three scheduling options - FIFO scheduler, Capacity scheduler and Fair scheduler.

FIFO Scheduler - FIFO scheduler puts application requests in queue and runs them in the order of submission.

Capacity Scheduler - Capacity scheduler has a separate dedicated queue for smaller jobs and starts them as soon as they are submitted.

Fair Scheduler - Fair scheduler dynamically balances and allocates resources between all the running jobs.

How do you setup ResourceManager to use FairScheduler?

You can configure the ResourceManager to use FairScheduler by setting the value of property 'yarn.resourcemanager.scheduler.class' to 'org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.fair.FairScheduler' in the file 'conf/yarn-site.xml'.
