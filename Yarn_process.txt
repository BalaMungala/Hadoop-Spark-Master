Yarn Process:-

User Submits a application to the cluster
RM (resource manager) Creates an application ID
RM starts a container Called as XapplicationMaster(Where X= MapReduce Or Spark or TEZ etc)
AM(Application Master) Figures out how many number of mapper or Reducers are required to run that Application
AM goes to the resource Manager and Asks for the Required Containers (Yarn child container)
Resource manager goes to the Node Manager and asks to create the YC Containers
Node Manager Creates the container and AM runs the Map/Reduce tasks in those Containers
Once the app is finished , Am daemon is killed and all the the YC containers processes are also killed.

Note:- a: There will always be one application master per application.
		b: Resource manager Will connect with Namenode to figure out the Block IDs/Block locations of the input data.
		c:Depending upon the location of the blocks of the input data, RM will always ask those Node Managers to create the YC containers where the Blocks of the data exist.
